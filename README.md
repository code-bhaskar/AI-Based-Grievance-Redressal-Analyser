1. Overview
The AI-Based Grievance Redressal Analyser is a GenAI-driven system built to assist senior police officers in evaluating the quality and completeness of grievance redressal processes. The system improves accuracy, consistency, and efficiency by automating the extraction of claims from complaints, providing tailored evidence checklists, scoring responses, and recommending petition statuses.

2. Goals & Objectives
•	Identify low-quality grievance closures through automated analysis.
•	Extract discrete claims from natural language complaints using LLMs.
•	Provide tailored evidence checklists for each extracted claim.
•	Enable quality assessment of Investigation Officer (IO) responses.
•	Assist senior officers in approving or escalating petition closures.
•	Improve the consistency, transparency, and speed of the redressal process.
•	Restore public trust by enabling fair and data-driven grievance handling.

3. Scope of the Solution
3.1 Core Modules / AI Agents
1.	Claim Extraction Agent
o	Extracts discrete, actionable claims from unstructured text complaints.
o	Maps them to one of five predefined claim categories for the prototype:
	Delay in investigation
	Improper behavior
	Missing evidence
	Faulty FIR content
	Lack of follow-up
2.	Checklist Generator Agent
o	Generates evidence checklist for each claim type.
o	Ensures IOs gather relevant materials and documents during investigation.
3.	Response Quality Scorer Agent
o	Evaluates IO’s responses against extracted claims and the evidence checklist.
o	Uses rubric-based scoring: Poor, Inadequate, Adequate, Excellent.
4.	Petition Status Evaluator Agent
o	Suggests final petition status: Closed, Reinvestigation Required, or Escalate to Senior.
o	Supports override and manual input by senior officers.
3.2 Interfaces
•	Investigation Officer (IO) Petition Screen
o	View extracted claims and checklists.
o	Upload evidence and input responses.
o	Track quality score and system suggestions.
•	Senior Officer Dashboard
o	View all petitions with summarized statuses.
o	Drill into claims, evidence, and IO responses.
o	Accept, edit, or reject system recommendations.

6. Non-Goals
•	Multi-language complaint handling (limited to English for prototype)
•	Handling of handwritten or scanned complaints without OCR
•	Expansion beyond 5 grievance categories during hackathon phase
________________________________________
7. Assumptions
•	Digital complaints are in machine-readable format.
•	IOs are trained on how to use the checklist and interface.
•	Senior officers have the authority to override AI-generated suggestions.
•	Internet connectivity and basic device access are available at police stations.
________________________________________
8. Constraints
•	Hackathon timeframe limits number of categories and scale.
•	Needs to run on limited hardware, possibly offline/local-first mode.
•	UI must be minimal and training-light for quick adoption.

9. Dependencies
•	GenAI models for NLP (claim extraction, summarization, scoring)
•	Secure data storage and access control for sensitive complaints
•	Backend support for task management and audit logging
